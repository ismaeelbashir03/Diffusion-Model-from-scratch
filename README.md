# Diffusion-Model-from-scratch
This is my first attempt at a diffusion model (unconditional) from scratch. based mostly on the the first diffusion model paper, other sources used for saving and sampling.

Please use a gpu when running the test.py file as u you need a some vram to run this, if your having memory issues decrease the number of samples per run.

please look at results folder for some generated images (bear in mind that i only trained for 200 epochs, since it was taking forever and was costing money, you can train for longer and it will produces clearer results like in the paper. I also used image sizes of 64 by 64 to decrease training time, for more high resolution images, training will be way longer.)
